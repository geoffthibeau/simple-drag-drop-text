# simple-drag-drop-text package for the Atom editor

Drag and drop to move text using the mouse.  This mimics the standard behavior of many other editors.  Dragging and dropping with the `ALT` key held will copy the text instead of moving it.

### Installation

Enter `atom install simple-drag-drop-text` or use the settings page.

---

### Usage

There is no Atom command.  

Drag/drop is triggered by clicking and dragging a text selection from one palce to another. Dragging with no modifer key will move the text to the position the mouse is released.  If the `ALT` key is down when the mouse is released then the text will be copied instead of moved.  The `ALT` key does not have to pressed before this time.

### Alternative Package 

There is a sister package to this one, `drag-drop-text`.  It offers more features but it has a small learning curve and does not follow the standard behavior of other editors.  This is for true mouse-loving geeks (like me).

Drag-drop-text package features ...

- No need for any modifier key like `ALT` for any operation.  Everything is done with the left mouse button.
- You can do the standard cut (`ctrl-x`), copy (`ctrl-c`), and paste (`ctrl-v`) operations using only the mouse.
- Text that has been dragged is left in the clipboard.  So you can drag and then paste the same text again.
